<p><strong>Hops</strong> have become the traditional beer spice, and you will not find a beer today that doesn't have some hops in it.  Botanically, they're little green flowers that look like pine-cones and grow on vines. They are acidic, and when boiled they give beer its bitter and acidic flavor.  Bitter herbs were originally added to beer to help preserve it, and over time as hops has become the dominant bittering agent, its flavor and aroma has become definitive of what makes a beer a beer. To imagine what a beer would taste and smell like without hops, imagine expired doughy porridge.  Less crisp? Less fresh? Disgusting? Yup. Hops come in either pellet or whole dried flowers, and itâ€™s important to refrigerate them so they keep their freshness and flavor compounds which will evaporate over time.</p>
